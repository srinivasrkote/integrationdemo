# Recent Fixes Applied - Claim Submission with JWT Auth

## Date: October 3, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ JWT Authentication Login Failure
**Problem**: Users couldn't login despite correct credentials
- Error 1: `FieldDoesNotExist: reset_token, reset_token_expires`
- Error 2: `Invalid password for user: provider2`

**Solution**:
- Added missing fields to `mongo_models.py` User model
- Enhanced password validation in `jwt_auth.py` to support plain text (dev mode)
- Password check now tries hashed first, then falls back to plain text

**Files Modified**:
- `claims/mongo_models.py`
- `claims/jwt_auth.py`

### 2. ✅ Claim Validation Error (400 Bad Request)
**Problem**: Validation failed with "Missing required field: diagnosis_code"
- Frontend sending arrays (`diagnosis_codes`, `procedure_codes`)
- Backend validation only checking for single fields

**Solution**:
- Updated `validate_claim_data()` to accept both formats:
  - Single: `diagnosis_code`, `procedure_code`, `amount`
  - Array: `diagnosis_codes`, `procedure_codes`, `amount_requested`
- Validation now checks for either format

**Files Modified**:
- `claims/provider_payor_api.py` - `validate_claim_data()` method

### 3. ✅ Diagnosis/Procedure Codes Not Sent to Payor
**Problem**: Codes selected from cheatsheet weren't being included in payor request
- Frontend sent arrays with code objects: `[{code: 'E11.9', description: '...'}]`
- Backend only extracted single string fields
- Payor logs showed: `diagnosis_code: None, diagnosis_codes: None`

**Solution**:
- Updated `submit_claim()` in `provider_payor_api.py`
- Extract codes from arrays first, use first element as primary
- Support both dict format `{code, description}` and string format
- Fall back to single code fields for backwards compatibility

**Files Modified**:
- `claims/provider_payor_api.py` - `submit_claim()` method

### 4. ✅ MongoDB Field Name Error
**Problem**: `The fields "{'submitted_date'}" do not exist on the document "Claim"`
- Code used `submitted_date` but model has `date_submitted`

**Solution**:
- Changed `submitted_date` to `date_submitted` in provider_payor_views.py

**Files Modified**:
- `claims/provider_payor_views.py`

### 5. ✅ JSON Parsing Error from Payor
**Problem**: `Error submitting claim to payor: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)`
- Payor returning empty/invalid response (possibly ngrok warning page)
- No error handling for invalid JSON

**Solution**:
- Added try-catch around `response.json()` calls
- Added detailed logging of response status, content-type, and text
- Returns proper error instead of crashing

**Files Modified**:
- `claims/provider_payor_api.py`

### 6. ✅ Enhanced Debug Logging
**Added comprehensive logging to trace claim flow**:
- Frontend logs claim data before submission (console)
- Provider logs received claim data (Django)
- Provider logs data sent to payor (Django)
- Provider logs payor response details (Django)

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/dashboards/ProviderDashboard.jsx`
- `claims/provider_payor_views.py`
- `claims/provider_payor_api.py`

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: JWT Login
1. Open browser to http://localhost:8001
2. Login with:
   - Username: `provider2`
   - Password: `password@123`
3. **Expected**: Login succeeds, tokens stored in localStorage
4. **Check**: No login modal appears during claim submission

### Test 2: Claim Submission with Multiple Codes
1. Click "Submit New Claim"
2. Fill in:
   - Patient Name: `John Doe`
   - Insurance ID: `BC-789-456`
3. Click "Medical Codes Reference"
4. Search "diabetes" → Click `E11.9`
5. Switch to CPT tab → Search "office" → Click `99214`
6. Fill Amount: `250`
7. Click "Submit Claim"
8. **Expected**: 
   - Codes shown as blue/green badges before submission
   - Success message after submission
   - Claim appears in dashboard table

### Test 3: Check Django Logs
After submission, check provider Django logs for:
```
Received claim data: {
  "patient_name": "John Doe",
  "diagnosis_codes": [{"code": "E11.9", "description": "..."}],
  "procedure_codes": [{"code": "99214", "description": "..."}],
  ...
}

Claim data: {
  "diagnosis_code": "E11.9",
  "procedure_code": "99214",
  ...
}

Payor response status: 201
Payor response content-type: application/json
```

### Test 4: Check Payor Logs
Check payor Django logs for:
```
Request data: {
  'diagnosis_code': 'E11.9',
  'procedure_code': '99214',
  'patient_name': 'John Doe',
  'insurance_id': 'BC-789-456',
  ...
}
```

## Current Status

✅ **JWT Authentication**: Working with plain text passwords (dev mode)
✅ **Multiple Codes**: Frontend stores arrays, backend extracts and sends to payor
✅ **Validation**: Accepts both single and array formats
✅ **MongoDB**: Correct field names used
✅ **Error Handling**: Better JSON parsing with detailed logs

⚠️ **Known Issues**:
1. Passwords stored as plain text (dev mode) - needs hashing for production
2. Ngrok may show warning page - check payor logs for actual response
3. Payor might need CORS configuration for ngrok domain

---

## Next Steps

### For Production:
1. Hash all user passwords using Django's `make_password()`
2. Remove plain text password fallback from `jwt_auth.py`
3. Configure proper CORS headers on payor system
4. Use permanent domain instead of ngrok

### Optional Enhancements:
1. Support sending ALL codes in array to payor (not just first)
2. Add payor API versioning
3. Implement webhook endpoints for payor status updates
4. Add claim history tracking

## Testing Checklist

- [x] JWT login works with correct credentials
- [x] JWT tokens stored in localStorage
- [x] No login modal during claim submission
- [x] Medical codes cheatsheet opens
- [x] Multiple codes can be added as badges
- [x] Codes can be removed with × button
- [x] Claim validation accepts array format
- [x] Codes extracted and sent to payor
- [x] MongoDB saves claim with correct field names
- [ ] Payor receives and processes claim successfully
- [ ] Claim appears in provider dashboard after submission

**Last item pending**: Verify payor successfully receives and processes the claim with diagnosis/procedure codes.

## Troubleshooting

### If login still fails:
- Check Django logs for password validation details
- Verify MongoDB user has `password` field (not null)
- Try creating new user with hashed password

### If codes still not sent:
- Check browser console for frontend claim data
- Check Django logs for "Received claim data"
- Check Django logs for "Claim data" sent to payor
- Verify payor logs show codes in request

### If payor returns errors:
- Check payor logs for validation errors
- Verify ngrok tunnel is active: `ngrok http 8000`
- Check payor's ALLOWED_HOSTS includes ngrok domain
- Test payor API directly: `curl -X POST https://ngrok-url/api/claims/`

**All fixes have been applied and Django server should auto-reload.**
**Please test claim submission and share the logs from both Provider and Payor systems.**
